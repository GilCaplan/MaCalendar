# Results log

Every meaningful run, newest first. **Always: metric + slice + the commit that
produced it.** Baselines are replayed, not frozen — cite the score report and
md5, not "the dataset".

## Cycle 1 — dev-fast(250) baseline + hypothesis (2026-09-04, code @ 2588612)

**Measurement** (metric: count-correctness; slice: dev-fast ranks 1–250;
report `engine_compare/engine_run.score.md`, wall-clock 4882 s ≈ 81 min with
the app stack up):

- overall: engine **73.2%** vs old brain 67.2% (29 flipped better / 14 worse)
- by complexity: simple 89% · medium 91% · **complex 40%** (the frontier)
- by compound kind: event+event **52%** (n=27) · task+task **35%** (n=20) ·
  event+task **35%** (n=37)
- event+task missing half: **event missing 20** · task missing 4 · both present 13
- parse path: deep 76% · fast 70% · garbage titles 1%

**Interpretation** (from `actions_json` of the failing rows — the event half is
rarely *dropped*; it is created as the wrong kind, or held back):

- **(A) dominant: reminder-phrased event halves become todos, even with clock
  times.** "create a birthday wish reminder for tomorrow **at 10 AM**",
  "remind me to go to my doctors **at 4pm**", "my meeting **at 3pm**" — all
  `create_todo`. The pinned product rule (remind + clock time ⇒ event) is
  implemented in segment's deterministic `_kind_of`, but the LLM's kind label
  wins on the deep path and is never corrected — so generate's own
  event-kind-retry safety net (which exists and works) never fires, because the
  item arrives labeled "task".
- (B) smaller: vague event halves ("Set a event for the evening", "pencil me in
  for sarahs birthday thing") parse to unknown and are held back honestly.
- (C) a slice of "failures" are convention clashes: "remind me to \<verb\> +
  date-only" is a task-with-due-date by product design but an event in the
  dataset's ground truth. Consciously NOT chased — the product rule stands.
- Also seen: the fast path mangling a compound outright ("Remind me to read
  book next week — and…" → three garbage todos) — a separate pile for a later
  cycle.

**Hypothesis (cycle 1):** making the deep path obey the *existing* pinned rule
— override an LLM "task" label to "event" when the text has remind/reminder
phrasing AND a clock time (`segment.py` internals only; contracts frozen; it
makes the LLM path agree with `_kind_of`'s deterministic path, no new
convention) — will let generate's event-retry engage for those items.
**Expected:** event+event 52% → ~58–60%, event+task 35% → ~40%, overall
dev-fast +1–2 pt; simple/medium and task+task flat (the override touches only
remind+clock-time items). Modest by design: one narrow, attributable change.

**Actual (rerun @ e956763, 2265 s):** overall 73.2 → **76.0%** (+2.8 — above
the predicted +1–2); event+task 35 → **41%** (predicted ~40 — on the nose);
event+event 52 → **56%** (predicted ~58–60 — right direction, slightly under:
two of its failures are the `update_todo`-misread and no-remind-word forms the
narrow rule deliberately skips); task+task 35 → 35 flat ✓; simple 89 → 91 and
medium 91 → 92 — a small **unexpected** gain: the rule also catches
single-command timed reminders the LLM mislabels on the deep path, not only
compound halves. complex 40 → 44. event-missing halves 20 → 18. Also novel:
p50 latency 9.5 s → 5.7 s, p95 74 s → 31 s (plausibly less unknown/retry
churn now the event-kind retry succeeds; possibly partly warmer caches — not
claimed as a fix effect). **Verdict: confirmed → graduated; the dev-full
confirm will be batched with the next cycle's win. Next pile: task+task 35%
(n=20), untouched by this fix as predicted.**

## Baseline — old brain on the full 3000 (verified 2026-09-04 20:56)

- **count-correct 70%** overall — `baseline/dummy_3000.db`
  (md5 `2511537fb93c32d28b87fe1998f77275`), report `dummy_3000.score.md`.
- Caveats (per the dataset owner): the db is not bit-reproducible (~75%
  determinism on regen); one row (tier_rank 2022, "Open calendar. Set event.")
  was replayed post-build and parses differently — negligible for aggregates.
- Frozen inputs: `inputs/history_3000.json`, `inputs/hwu64_sample.json`.

## engine-v2 vs baseline — count-correctness (metric #1)

| run | code @ | slice | old | engine | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| full-3000 | (round 5) | overall | 70.0% | **74.0%** | 252 better / 135 worse |
| full-3000 | (round 5) | held-out 601–3000 (n=2400, sealed) | 69.5% | **73.5%** | +4.0, generalises |
| full-3000 | (round 5) | complex | 29% | **39%** | the frontier |
| full-3000 | (round 5) | event+event | 20% | **36%** | decompose gain |
| full-3000 | (round 5) | event+task | 17% | **35%** | decompose gain |
| dev-full 600 | (cycles 2–3) | overall | 71% | 74.2% | invention guards — flat on this metric (they fix precision, not count) |

Other metrics on the full-3000 engine run: garbage titles ≤1%, cross-event
date collapse ≤2%, missing-half = the *event* dropped in 72% of event+task
failures, parse-path fast 76% / deep 71%.

## Reading note

The invention-guard cycles (remove-echo, question-creates-nothing, quote-shed)
did not move count-correctness — they fix *invention* (precision), which this
metric barely sees. Right fix, wrong ruler: a precision-class change needs a
precision metric. This is why every entry names its metric.
